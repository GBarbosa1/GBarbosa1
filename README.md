###ğŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Gabriel

ğŸ“Š Currently, I'm collaborating with a dynamic data team, dedicated to enhancing and democratizing data utilization within our organization. ğŸš€

ğŸ“ˆ In my previous life, I was a Product Owner/Project Manager who thrived on generating data-driven insights from vast datalakes. ğŸ’¡

ğŸ’» My GitHub repositories showcase a diverse array of scripts designed for interacting with or scraping financial data. You'll also discover repositories used for personal exploration and study. ğŸ“š

ğŸ’° I have a deep passion for financial data and enjoy diving into its intricacies. Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of my financial data tinkering projects! ğŸ“‰
